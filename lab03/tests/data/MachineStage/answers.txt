On the first (zeroth?) floor of Soda, below the labs, you find a mysterious machine.
It has holes for two lists of ints of the same length, and a third hole that looks
like it would output a number. The label reads:

    'SumOfElementWiseMax-inator'

... Huh. You decide to experiment with the machine for a bit.

Enter a sequence of ints, separated by commas:
Enter a second sequence, with the same number of ints:
The machine whirrs briefly before outputting a slip of paper, reading 26
Does that seem right to you?
Enter [y] if you want to move on, and anything else to try again.
Satisfied with your tinkering, you leave the machine behind.
It's almost time for lecture! How are you attending?
