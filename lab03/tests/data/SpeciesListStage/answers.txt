Inside Professor Hug's office, you see some O'Reilly books. These books have cool animals on the
covers. As a budding computer scientist, you should be able to identify all kinds of neat animals.
Here's a few:

- These large felines with spots will teach you how to react quickly.
- This native american bovine can be found in the plains, and happens to be EXTREMELY good at Java.
- Type their names into the terminal (separated by ',')
Woah! There are even more neat books here!
- These bushy-tailed friends are everywhere in and around the trees on campus, and know the best parts of Java.
- These tiny birds flap very fast, drink nectar, and know how to make simpler Java appplications.
- Type their names into the terminal (separated by ',')
Well, there's nothing left here! press enter to move.
Wow! That was pretty neat! We got to see so many neat animals! We should study now, so let's go to the Woz.
